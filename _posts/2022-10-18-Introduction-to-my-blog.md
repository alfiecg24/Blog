Welcome to my blog! It's likely that you don't know me, so this post can help anyone get to know who I am and what I do.
I'm 15 years old, and I spend my time building apps and hacking my iDevices. As of today, I have 1 app on the App Store
called "Focus: Revision Timer". It's a simple revision timer built in SwiftUI and I plan to use it for all my GCSE
revision.

I also love to jailbreak my devices - but not like the average user. Instead of theming my phone, or installing pirated
apps, I like the real barebones stuff. Downgrades, dualboots and BootROM exploits are my favourite - after all, that's
the true use of jailbreaking.

Over the summer, I spent time with PongoOS and linux-apple to boot Linux on my iPad Pro. This was after I downgraded it
to iPadOS 14.8 with SHSH2 blobs. I find the whole process fascinating. That's why I'm trying to learn how to create similar
things. I'm familiarising myself with the iOS system, and popular projects. I recently authored several commits in idevicerestore
which help to check if a device is vulnerable to limera1n before exploitation. I plan to add checkm8 to the list of exploits
available in the program son.

Anyways, that's about as far as I've got so far - with much more to come! For now, I'll sign off.
